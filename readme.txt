abstract:
Retina blood vessel detection plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of various retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and hypertension. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the automated detection of blood vessels in retinal images. Our method leverages advanced image processing techniques, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, to accurately delineate blood vessels from the surrounding tissue. Specifically, we employ a combination of morphological operations, Gaussian filters, and machine learning algorithms to achieve robust segmentation of blood vessels. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high accuracy and sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method shows promising potential for real-time applications in clinical settings, paving the way for improved screening and management of retinal diseases.
